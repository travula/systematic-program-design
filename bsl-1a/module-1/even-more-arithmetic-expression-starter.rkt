;Write the BSL expression that represents the arithmetic expression: (6 + 3) *
;(9 - 7) which equals 18.  Do not just write 18! Instead, write a BSL
;expression that clearly mirrors the arithmetic expression.

(* (+ 6 3) (- 9 7))

;Write the BSL expression that represents the arithmetic expression (7 - 2) * 4
;which equals 20.  Do not just write 20! Instead write BSL expression that
;clearly mirrors (7 - 2) * 4.

(* (- 7 2) 4)
